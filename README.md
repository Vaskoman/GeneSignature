# GeneSignature
Gene signature to consider when testing downstream signaling effects (for A. Martineau). PBMCs and epithelium.
Import already analysed data (masterTableUp and masterTableDown).
Import datasets metadata table.
Get a number of genes (to be determined) that are regulated in the most datasets in the same direaction (epithelial and PBMCs). Keep only relevant epithelial datasets (1. breast; 2. prostate) and exclute hepatic, pancreatic, and corneal epithelium from the analysis.
Analyse GSE47460 data to obtain some measure of mRNA expression levels in airway epithelium.
Align candidate epithelium genes with genes detected in GSE47460 (well expressed).
